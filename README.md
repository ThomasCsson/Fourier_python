# Mathematical modelling scripts
Repository of python scripts to compute various mathematical operations.
For now:
- a function approximation model by Fourier series
- a function approximation model by Taylor series

These methods aren't necessarily the most elegant nor the most efficient computationally speaking, but are nice visualisations and that's what matters.
